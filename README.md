# 🔥 Starkflare
This tool aims to monitor the resource usage of rollups in the StarkNet ecosystem, starting with StarkNet Mainnet. Its goal is to assist rollup developers in making their rollups cheaper, faster, and more efficient by providing real-time usage patterns of resources such as calldata, storage, and gas consumption. 

# 🙋‍♀️ Collaborate with us on starkflare v1
